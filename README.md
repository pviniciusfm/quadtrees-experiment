# Quadtrees Experiment with P5 in python

# Requirements

## MacOS 
Most package systems such as homebrew, aptitude, etc already have the required GLFW binaries. For instance, to install GLFW on Mac using homebrew, run

$ brew install glfw

## Linux
Similarly, on Debian (and itâ€™s derivatives like Ubuntu and Linux Mint) run

$ sudo apt-get install libglfw3
For other Linux based systems, find and install the GLFW package using the respective package system

## Run
```
$ python quadtree.py
```

# Features

We can paint the quadtree and visualize its subdivisions in realtime

# Next steps

1. Implement range query by delimiting a rectangle
2. Implement a query implementing another shape 
3. Highlight results with another color
